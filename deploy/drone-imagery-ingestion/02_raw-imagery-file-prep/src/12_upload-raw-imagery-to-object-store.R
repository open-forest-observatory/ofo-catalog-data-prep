## Purpose: Upload the data in the upload staging directory created in previous step to CyVerse.

# IMPORTANT NOTE: You must have already configured an rclone remote on this machine for the object
# store. This is already done automatically on ofo dev images. The config should look like this:
# https://github.com/open-forest-observatory/ofo-ansible/blob/main/roles/ofo/files/rclone.conf In
# addition, you must have your S3 credentials set in the environment variables RCLONE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID and
# RCLONE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. You can do this by running the following command (change the values to
# yours): export RCLONE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id; export
# RCLONE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
