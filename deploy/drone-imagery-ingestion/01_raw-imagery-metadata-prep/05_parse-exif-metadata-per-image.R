# Purpose: Read a CSV file containing the EXIF data for all images and extract standardized
# metadata. The sensor/platform is used to correctly interpret the metadata conventions. This comes
# from the contributed metadata (from Baserow), which is the only reason the contributed metadata is
# being read.

# sf needs to be included or else the bind_rows call to create polygon_perdataset fails. I don't
# understand the concept of dispatching and why this is required.
