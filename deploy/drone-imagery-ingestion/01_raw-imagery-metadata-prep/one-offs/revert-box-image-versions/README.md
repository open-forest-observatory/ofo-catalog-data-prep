This folder contains code and data to deal with an unexpected issue where somehow, the 4 images per mission that we selected to be thumbnails became swapped randomly with each other. This didn't matter too much because we sorted images by timestamp and renamed them, but it matters specifically in the case of multi-sub-mission missions, where the swapping could have happened between sub-missions. Fortunately, all the swapped images have their originals on Box in an V1 of the file. So this folder contains a script to find all files where this happened (files modified on a specific 2-date range when the new versions were uploaded that have 2 versions). I manually inspected this list and pared it down to the ones we need to revert (a separate CSV). Then there is a separate script to revert these files to their old version. These scripts use the Box API via the Box python SDK and were mostly written by Claude.
