# Purpose: For each sub-mission, pull the relevant Baserow metadata. For each mission, merge the
# pulled sub-mission data into a mission-level record by concatenating the multiple different values
# where they differ. Save out the mission-level and sub-mission-level data. If the dataset
# association records indicate that a mission is one part of a two-part grid, change the
# mission-level mission type from "normal" to "grid".

# TODO: Currently, we are ignoring cases where there are two baserow records for a mission, but the
# mission could not be split out into sub-missions that we were confident corresponded to the two
# baserow records. The occurrence of this is recorded in the crosswalks in 1c_exif-for-sorting. When
# this occurred, all missions were crosswalked to the first Baserow record. We could improve this
# script's workflow to take the non-directly-assignable records into account and report both entries
# for any attributes that differ between the two records for an unsplittable dataset.
